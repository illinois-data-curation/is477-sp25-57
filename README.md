## Description  
This notebook reproduces the workflow for Analysis of Housing Affordability by County Using Census and Property Data.  

# Summary
Housing affordability is a constant issue in the United States, as it disproportionately affects low-income households and creates more socioeconomic disparities. Recent data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition (2023) highlights the severity of this ongoing housing crisis by revealing that only 33 affordable rental units exist for every 100 extremely low-income (ELI) households. This is a deficit of 7.3 million homes, and this number grew by 8% during the pandemic. With the rise in housing costs, consistently stagnant wages, and regional economic imbalances, it is clear that securing affordable housing is becoming increasingly difficult for many families. The purpose of this project is to analyze the relationship between housing affordability, demographic characteristics, and socioeconomic factors across the U.S., utilizing data from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). By examining variations in housing costs relative to income levels, family structures, and regional economic conditions, the study aims to uncover patterns that influence affordability challenges for different groups. By analyzing patterns in housing costs relative to income levels, family structures, and population characteristics, we seek to better understand how affordability challenges differ across various groups and locations. For instance, single-parent households may experience different financial pressures compared to dual-income families, while affordability gaps may be more pronounced in states with higher poverty rates.

The study explores several key research questions to enhance the understanding of housing affordability dynamics. First, it investigates how housing affordability vary across U.S. states, as measured by the cost-to-income ratio of the states. Second, it examines which socioeconomic and demographic factors most strongly influence housing affordability at the county level, and how do those factors interact. Third, it analyzes how unit types and renter household sizes contribute to the shortage of affordable three-bedroom units, as identified by the NLIHC. Additionally, the study assesses how climate risk factors—such as flood zones and windborne debris regions—compound housing cost burdens for vulnerable populations. Finally, it identifies which property characteristics (e.g., construction type, year built) most strongly predict the value of a home and how this affects long-term affordability. 

Together, these questions provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the multifaceted nature of housing affordability challenges.

To address these questions, this project makes use of a mixed-method approach by combining two datasets for a deeper analysis. The first dataset, the 2023 ACS, provides detailed demographic, economic, and housing data at both state and county levels, including median household income, population estimates, and housing characteristics. The second dataset, which is sourced from Kaggle’s House Price Prediction Dataset by InsuranceHub-USA, offers property-level insights, including structural characteristics (such as construction type and square footage), geospatial risk factors (e.g., flood zones, distance to coast), insurance metrics (e.g., claims history), and market dynamics (e.g., sale prices). By merging these datasets using FIPS codes, the analysis can correlate socioeconomic conditions with real estate trends, providing a holistic view of affordability drivers.

Methodologically, the project leverages Python for data integration and analysis, employing different regression techniques tailored to each research question. For the first three questions—focused on cost-burden disparities—multilevel regression will assess variations across states, family structures, and poverty tiers.

# Data profile
The datasets used are crucial for the exploration of the relationships between socioeconomic factors and housing prices across the United States, using two complementary datasets. The primary dataset comes from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, which provides comprehensive demographic, economic, and housing data at state and county levels. This dataset includes critical variables such as median household income (S1901_C01_012E), home values (S2503_C01_001E), rent burdens (S2507_C01_001E), and poverty rates (S1701_C01_042E), enabling us to test observed disparities like Nevada's 17 affordable units per 100 ELI households versus South Dakota's 58. The ACS is a public dataset produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, a federal agency. As a work of the U.S. government, ACS data is not subject to copyright and is freely available for public use under open data principles. We used the ACS data to analyze patterns in housing affordability relative to household income, family structure, and poverty levels across U.S. states. The data was filtered and aggregated using custom Python scripts, and used in conjunction with other datasets to compare regional disparities in affordability. The second dataset was obtained from Kaggle, where InsuranceHub-USA, a third-party contributor, uploaded it. This dataset provides detailed information on residential property characteristics and estimated sale prices for homes across the United States. It includes features such as: property type and number of rooms, square footage, year built, construction type and materials, insurance claim history (e.g., NumberOfClaims), and regional risk factors (e.g., FloodZoneRiskLevel, WindborneDebrisRegion). The House Price Prediction Dataset (source: InsuranceHub-USA, Kaggle) does not specify explicit licensing terms in its description. While the lack of a clear license typically requires caution, this dataset is being used here strictly for non-commercial, educational/research purposes with proper attribution. All analyses and derivative work will cite the original source, and no redistribution of the raw data is intended. If future licensing terms are clarified by the creator, compliance will be prioritized. We used this dataset to investigate how property-specific features and climate risk indicators correlate with insurance claim frequency, and how these factors affect long-term housing affordability. We integrated this data with ACS-derived socioeconomic indicators to study the compounding effects of risk and vulnerability on housing burden. Custom data cleaning and integration scripts were used to align the geographic and categorical variables across datasets.

# Findings

Our analysis reveals significant disparities in housing affordability across states, and property characteristics, highlighting how demographic and environmental factors compound financial stress in the U.S. housing market.

1. Housing Affordability by Cost to Income:
We calculated the ratio of median home value to median household income across all of the U.sS. states to assess housing affordability. The results of the research showed harsh geographic disparities with Florida residents facing the most severe affordability crisis. According to the results, the median home prices in Florida are 7.65 times higher than median incomes. The other high cost states include Massachusettes with a 2.22 ratio and New Hampshire with a 1.37 ratio. The housing costs for these states consume significantly large portions of household budgets, compared to other states like Louisiana (which has a .24 ratio) and New Mexico (with a .25 ratio). These states show balanced housing markets as their home values are a quarter of median incomes. However, despite the information pointing out that Florida is the state with a home value that far exceeds the median income, it is likely that the data may have issues and need correction.
2. Socioeconomic and Demographic Factors Influencing Housing Affordability:
The analysis reveals that the most powerful predictor of housing affordabilirty is population density, as it shows a strong negative correlation with cost-to-income rations and essentially suggests that denser areas tend to be more affordable. This could be due to greater housing supply and more efficient land use. Poverty rates on the other hand show a positive association with affordability, meaning even marginal increases correlate with significantly worse housing costs. This highlights how the low-income households are facing disproportionate pressures when trying to afford houses. This analysis also shows a small yet significant link between older populations and reduced affordability.
3. Shortage of 3+ Bedroom Units:
To assess whether there's a mismatch between housing unit sizes and household needs, we intended to compare the availability of 3+ bedroom homes to the proportion of large households (those with three or more members) across geographic areas. However, the dataset does not include a NumberOfBedrooms column, which limits our ability to perform this analysis. As a result, we were unable to directly evaluate potential bedroom shortages. Future versions of the dataset or supplementary data sources that include detailed unit characteristics would be necessary to fully explore this question.
4. Impact of Climate Risk on Affordability:
We created a map to explore the relationship between flood risk zones and rent burden across regions, using flood risk level as color and rent-to-income ratio as the marker size. The visualization highlights a concentration of high flood risk areas in Florida, with many of the bubbles (representing rent burden) appearing large—suggesting that in flood-prone areas, residents may be experiencing higher rent burdens. This spatial overlap implies that vulnerable populations might be disproportionately affected by both housing affordability and environmental hazards. Such dual exposure raises concerns about the resilience of these communities and calls for targeted policy interventions that address both climate adaptation and housing affordability.
5. Housing Value and Construction Factors:
To identify the most influential factors behind the value of houses, we created a correlation matrix to examine three variables: ValueofHome’, ‘Year Built’, ‘Adj Square Feet’, and ‘Construction Type’. The size of a home (AdjSquareFeet) showed the strongest positive correlation (with a correlation value of 0.54), which indicates that larger homes tend to be more valuable. In contrast, the construction year (YearBuilt) demonstrates almost no relationship with home value (with a correlation value of 0.02), suggesting that a property's age alone doesn't significantly influence its current market price in this dataset. The analysis shows that square footage is the most reliable predictor of home value among these variables, while other factors like age and construction type appear less influential in this linear model.

# Future work
This project revealed the deep interdependence between housing affordability, demographic dynamics, environmental risk, and structural property characteristics. By integrating data from the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) with the InsuranceHub-USA property dataset, we gained insight into how different families and communities experience the U.S. housing market in fundamentally unequal ways.
However, we also encountered several data and methodological limitations that shaped the direction and depth of our analysis. For example, the lack of granularity in bedroom counts prevented us from directly evaluating potential shortages in larger rental units, a critical factor in understanding housing stress for families. Similarly, missing values in the property-level insurance dataset (such as sparse data in the NumberOfClaims column) constrained the reliability of our regression results and limited our ability to fully explore predictive models of risk exposure. 
We also learned that aligning public datasets like the ACS with more specialized, private datasets (e.g., real estate insurance data) presents a challenge in terms of standardizing units, spatial granularity, and variable definitions. These issues, though technical, have real implications: they restrict the scope of insights that can be drawn and underscore the importance of consistent, open-access data collection and sharing standards across sectors.
Another important takeaway was the value of visualization in revealing patterns that are difficult to capture through summary statistics alone. Our flood zone map, for instance, made clear how environmental vulnerability and housing stress often overlap geographically. This kind of spatial storytelling may be especially persuasive in policy contexts, where data needs to not only be accurate but also compelling and actionable.
Based on these findings and limitations, we identify several promising directions for future work:
1. Integrating Missing Variables:
To address the limitations we faced in evaluating the availability of 3+ bedroom homes, future research should incorporate datasets with richer housing unit metadata. Additionally, improving access to more complete insurance claim data would strengthen risk modeling and allow for deeper exploration of how property characteristics correlate with affordability and resilience. Partnering with insurers or municipal databases could enhance this dimension.
2. Time Series and Longitudinal Analysis:
This study used only 2023 data, but housing affordability and environmental exposure are dynamic, long-term issues. A time series approach could track how affordability shifts over years in response to economic cycles, housing policy interventions, or climate-related events (e.g., post-disaster rent spikes or insurance cost inflation).
Longitudinal tracking would also allow researchers to investigate whether areas with sustained rent burdens or insurance risks experience long-term demographic shifts—such as displacement, gentrification, or migration outflows.
3. Equity-Centered Geographic Modeling:
In future work, a finer-grained spatial analysis, at the census tract or ZIP code level, could better reveal disparities that are masked by state-level averages. This would help identify local “hotspots” where housing costs, environmental vulnerability, and racial/ethnic segregation intersect.
For example, an equity-focused geographic model might combine rent burden data with redlining legacy maps, FEMA floodplain data, and local eviction records. This could surface patterns of compounded disadvantage and inform targeted housing resilience programs in historically underinvested communities.
